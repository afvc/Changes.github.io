            <p class=" col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-lg-8   no-margin-bot">
              Most of the “underground” media serving the counter-culture in the ‘60s have either long since disappeared or metamorphosed into slick-format ad-vehicles retailing narrow slices of life-style. Not so underground comix.

</p>

            <p class="sm-indent no-margin-bot col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-lg-8"> Originally started by a loose network of self-publishing cartoonists in 1968, these comix soon developed into an energetic if tiny industry. As most of the UG cartoonists lived in or migrated to San Francisco and Berkeley, 3 of the 4 main comix 
publishers sprang up there as well. (The fourth was located in Milwaukee!) 
</p>
            
             

            <p class="sm-indent col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-lg-8 ">The earliest UGs tryed emphasizzing  personalized 
humor about those great participant sports of the youth culture—sex and drugs. A third obsession, violence, was added soon, reflecting the atmosphere created by Manson, Altamont, and the war. This triumvirate of taboos in varying combinations monopolized most od the comix throughout the early 70’s.

</p> 
         
           
            <a class=" col-xs-10 margin-top">  <img class="ill sm-" src="assets/images/C-4.jpg" alt=" "> </a>
                 
                           
             
              <p class=" col-xs-11 col-sm-10 col-lg-8  no-margin-bot semi-title text-dark"> There were, of course, exceptions.  Comix edited and drawn by many women UG cartoonists took as their focus the real-life experiences and fantasies of women living in a male dominated culture. A number of “theme” comics spotlighted ecology, drug addiction and similar topics, as well. 


            </p>

             
            <p class="col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-lg-8  sm-indent no-margin-bot">
Sales faltered around ‘73-’74, due in part to the 1973 Supreme Court ruling on obscenity which left 
decisions as to what was obscene up to local “community standards.” UGs were suddenly becoming too risky, for many distributors and outlets were not willing to stick their necks out for the meagre profits the UGs 
earned. Moreover, the market was increasingly flooded with low-quality comix (many of which were published by those same fickle distributors).


            </p>
            
            
            
             


            <p class="col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-lg-8  sm-indent no-margin-bot">Whether due to widespread cultural satiation, inevitable artistic “maturity,” or simply boredom with old kicks, the venerable themes of sex, drugs, and violence are far less in evidence now. Humor, 
social satire, history, and educational strips rule the roost .


            </p>
            <p class="col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-lg-8   sm-indent no-margin-bot">Distribution, through alternative channels, is as spotty as ever, and the comix can be better found in some midwestern college towns than in Manhattan, for instance. 

            </p>
            
             <p class="col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-lg-8   sm-indent no-margin-bot">Accordingly, mail order has grown in importance, with most publishers carrying each other’s titles in addition to their own. Since availability (and prices) can change as time goes by, your best bet is to order the current catalogs from the publishers and mail order firms below before sending for specific 
comix change as time goes by.
