 All through the riots of ‘72 we watched, itching to leave the city but somehow still attached. I mean, we knew. We knew as early as ‘67, but it was so science-fictiony that we just kind of dreamed happily over it, making incredibly detailed lists, playing with the Ouijfi Board, studying astrology and making predictions in off-handedly superior ways. </p>

                <p class="sm-indent no-margin-bot   "> We got disillusioned in ‘68, and went on a lot of sidetrips, falling in love, losing it, moving, practicing all kinds of crafts, having babies. So we still waited, planning, collecting. In ‘73 we got into our bus and split for Oregon. </p>
                
                <p class="sm-indent no-margin ">We drove all night and the better part of the day, slept just in time to hear on the radio that Red China had started bombing somebody, but not us yet, thank God. We woke and drove again, through the night, and finally we got there, and fell on exhausted.</p>

In the morning the baby started to cry.  We got up. Outside the curtained windows of our bus, through the trees and the virgin country, we saw’seven tepees, three Volkswagen busses, two school busses, one Renault Dauphine with a pup tent on top of it, a half-litwn cabin, two chemical toilets, several dogs, more cats, a fire somewhere off in the distance, and stancieig around us were ninety-seven people. They looked: hungry. They all had long hair. Nobody was smiling. </p>
