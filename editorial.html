            <p class="text col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-lg-8 text-left no-margin"> Since the beggining of time Man changes every single thing he touches.Why? Maybe because its part of our nature, who knows. </p>
             <p class="text col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-lg-8 text-left sm-indent no-margin-top "> However, it is due to that specific trait of our kind that the world as we know it keeps changing every single day. That aspect is what we explore in every edition of this publication. The way Manâ€™s interventions with himself and nature can produce results as wonderfull as terrifying.</p>

            <p class="text col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-lg-8 text-left text-lightest no-margin"> While starting to read Changes it is possible to conclude that it contains a wide range of articles from several varied topics since War, Art and Technology to the Future, making it interesting for a large variety of readers.</p>
            <p class="text col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-lg-8 text-left sm-indent no-margin text-lightest "> It has a dense but uneven printing stain, due to the multiple flexible grids that have been adapted to the particular needs of each article. As for navigation, it can be classified as hypertext. One arrives at this conclusion due to the way most of the texts in English and Portugues relate to the respective illustrations, making the reader jump between pages in order to have access to the article that they are reading as an whole.</p>
             <p class="text col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-lg-8 text-left sm-indent no-margin text-lightest"> Getting to the most visual aspects, the ratio text/image, is around 30% images (of which 10% are advertisments) for 50% text and 20% white space. Changes format uses a 3: 4 with a 180mm x 240mm size not only to save paper, but also provide better editorial experience.
