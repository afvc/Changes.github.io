                "I wish everyone would do a book like this, made of the things they say to themselves to keep themselves doing what they do well. Embarrassing stuff — bombastic, personal, and wholly invaluable to anyone else trying to do something well. The revelant here is avant-garde filmmaker James Broughton. “

            <p class="sm-indent no-margin-bot col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-lg-8"> Excellent strategy: do what you are most afraid of doing. Look what Brakhage did. He has always feared death intensely, it has been a constant threatening imminence for him. So, with the courage that has always made him a trailblazer, he took his camera tightly in hand and went into the city morgue of Pittsburgh and looked closely and filmed unforgettably the forms of death as they had never been seen before. </p>


            <p class=" col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-lg-8  no-margin-bot semi-title text-light"> The Act of Seeing With One’s Own Eyes. The avant-garde task is to deal with what nobody else is attending to. This keeps widening human consciousness and keeps balance in the universe.

            <p class="sm-indent no-margin-bot col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-lg-8 "> Making a film is a more hazardous act than looking at one. For you will create a dream. Whereas dreams them- selves are natural events which happen to us. You will create a dream for others to dream and to be dreaded.
