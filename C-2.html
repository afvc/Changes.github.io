                “Every now and then we see something which sets a new level of excellence in how-to writing. That’s what this book does. The author is one of the best photographers around Suburbia, known for the kind, brutal frankness of his eye. The same goes for his writing. It’s all on the table, every inner trick and turn of how to be a photographer with your life. All the unspeakable stuff like getting published, getting grants, getting the confidence of subjects and the attention of audience, and not paying out too much immortal soul in the process.“

            <p class="sm-indent  col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-lg-8 ">The best place to get a start Is the small town or suburban newspaper. These papers are often “throw aways.” Basically they carry supermarket advertisements, but they also have an editorial department and use photographs. As a small town photographer I photographed everything; editorials, women’s pages, sports, features, and advertising. It was an experience more enriching than a big newspaper because I did seven to ten assignments a day, on a large city paper you seldom do more than two assignments a day . </p>

                Some excellent photojournalism will be being done on the small town paper. There you have the freedom to use good photography and develop your talents. If you can take a good picture o f Little League Baseball teams, you can take a good picture of the Oakland A’s. Perhaps the best jobs in photography today are on the small town newspaper because here you have personal freedom and, more important, space to publish yo photographs.

                Finally, go make friends with other photographers, journalists and writers. Share your information with them. Other photographers can help you get started by helping you understand editors and magazines. It’s tough work to compete with and sharing information is an important part of learning photography... These photographs illustrate the difference between the use of natural light and strobe light.

            <p class=" col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-lg-8  no-margin-bot semi-title text-dark"> The photograph on the left was taken with natural light. The prints 40% black; half the man’s face Is in deep shadow. As you can see, the print is dark and contrasty. And the high contrast presents the couple in an unattractive way. Both their faces are lit dramatically, and the woman’s hand looks more like a claw than a hand.
