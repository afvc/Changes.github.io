               A report compiled for the business community by Stanford Research Institute’s Business Intelligence Program has this to say: “The reason (distributed processing) in computer networks will not be available to the general public at an earlier date is primarily one of security. At present, fraudulent input or access to a data base management system cannot be prevented”.
</p>

            <p class="sm-indent no-margin-bot col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-lg-8"> This is a vital piece of information that the industry does not want you to know. There’s this security problem. Large, flexible time-shared computer systems are swiss cheese.</p>
            
             
              <p class=" col-xs-11 col-sm-10 col-lg-8  no-margin-bot semi-title text-dark"> Ask a programmer. Computer crime is a growth industry. Computer security is a myth.

            </p>

            <p class="sm-indent col-xs-12 col-sm-5 col-md-5 col-lg-5 sm-margin-tx">For every other new data encryption system, there’s a programmer out there somewhere who can crack it. A program that sneaks you into an operating system is called a Trojan Horse. At most computer centers, the Trojan Horse is already inside the gates. Some grim worst-case scenarios might just be floating through corporate corridors these days. Striking British civil servants recently turned off key government computer systems, and the result was chaos. Some of the information and assets probably will not be recoverable. The strikers simply pulled the plugs.

            <p class="col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-lg-8  sm-indent no-margin-bot">
Crude, but effective. But what about the likelihood of more sophisticated guerilla tactics, as computer know-how spreads throughout the populace? Quite a quandary for industry people: They want you as a customer, but can they trust you? They need to sell you computers and teach you the mechanics of programming, but they don’t want to let you too far into the distributed processing loop. As time goes by, you could become too smart for their own good. 

            </p>
            
            
            
             


            <p class="col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-lg-8  sm-indent no-margin-bot">Computer paranoia cuts both ways. The industry may be nervous about 
widespread consumer participation in future networks, but it seems much less concerned about consumer privacy abuses in current systems. It’s common knowledge — at least it should be — that information which goes into such 
systems, information about you, your habits and activities.

            </p>
            <p class="col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-lg-8   sm-indent no-margin-bot">It’s a muddy affair. Who decides who gets access to what? There’s reason to be wary of controls and Limitations on access to digitized information, and equal reason to worry about what will happen if there are no such controls. The deciding in theory will be a sociopoHtical matter; the accessing in truth will be by those who know how. And the what being accessed will be almost everything.
