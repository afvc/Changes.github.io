                Stockholm-The first city of the future will be built in Sweden. It will be called Jarfalla, have about 100,000 residents, and be accessible by subway or highway from Stockholm, just 12 miles away. No gasoline-powered vehicle will be allowed. Noiseless electric minibuses moving at a soothing 20 miles per hour will pass within 150 yards of everyone’s house, carrying passengers and baggage free.
            </p>



            <p class=" col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-lg-8   sm-indent"> Rolling platforms something like horizontal escalators will carry downtown shoppers on the Tounds, underground heating will melt snow as it falls to the sidewalks, garbage will be collected by vacuums installed in each residence and transported through tunnels by compressed air to incinerators 30 miles away.
            </p>



            <p class=" col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-lg-8   sm-indent"> Heat and hot water will be supplied by a single thermonuclear plant, the temperatures regulated by individual thermostats.</p>

            <figcaption class="smalltext center-xs col-sm-5 col-xs-12 col-md-10 sm-margin-top shadow"> Abstract illustration about the uncertainties of the future</figcaption>

            <p class=" col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-lg-8  no-margin-bot semi-title text-light"> The air will be pure, the smog-free light dazzling, the water delicious and whole- some, the streets impecable, the only, sounds those of music and children at play. It will cost an enormous amount of money.

            </p>




            <p class=" col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-lg-8  sm-indent no-margin-bot">Alas, we cannot be all Swedes, nor can all Swedes live in Jarfalla. By the time there are 7 billion of us hnilling around the planet, 30 years from now—or 9 billion, 20 or 30 years from now lives are likely to be arranged quite differently. Futurologists hold out a considerable range of repellent prospects. Among the most cheerful is Nigel Calder, former editor of New Science in England, whose ideas go something like this:</p>

            <p class=" col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-lg-8  quote-indent no-margin-top">

                hose of us still living on land may be enclosed in anything from towns of 50,000 completely under glass to cities of 50 million commanding nearly a million square miles— the size of Western Europe. But the majority of the human race will be settled on the sea, in floating towns reaching deep under water so that disturbance due to surface winds and waves—seasickness, that is—will be negligible. More likely than not, these towns will take the form of iceships, ice being unsinkable, easily landscapable, and relatively cheap to make and preserve (one doesn’t like to think of a possible power failure, but Mr. Calder assures us we needn’t worry). The icetowns would be protected against wind by geodetic domes, perfumed and decorated by thoughtfully contrived sights and sounds, air-conditioned to a year- round spring-like temperature, and supplied with food by ocean gardens grown either on imported soil or in enclosed and cultivated tanks of sea water.

            </p>


            <p class=" col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-lg-8  sm-indent no-margin-bot"> Limited as such nourishment may be to the palate, we might go down on our knees in gratitude for it, considering the possible alternatives. About 4 or 5 billion people would be facing starvation, few of us could permit ourselves the luxury of real fruit and vegetables (a cucumber, say, or a watermelon).
