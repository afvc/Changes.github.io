            <p class="title col-xs-12"> Man's role in changing the face of the earth</p>





            <p class="text col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-lg-8 text-left text-lightest no-margin-bot"> This book of almost 1200 pages is the result of a major conference held in 1955, sponsored by the Wenner Foundation for Anthropological Research. More than 50 scholars submitted papers, covering almost every point of view related to man’s capacity to transform his physical environment. Though first presented nearly 15 years ago, the facts and insights are richly rewarding today. In my opinion in fact, it is an unsurpassed achievement in assembling pertinent, insightful information of interest not only to serious students of the planet Earth.</p>

                <p class="sm-indent no-margin-bot text-lightest "> The three sections of the book are: I.“Retrospect”, a historical background, II.“Process”, methods & agencies involved in man’s interactions with the land and III.“Prospect”, the effects and future implications of man’s habitation...</p>
                <p class="sm-indent no-margin text-lightest">Some typical subjects covered with these sections include: fire as the great force employed by man origins and decline of woodlands man and grass ecology of peasant life harvests of the sea ports channels and coast-lines and sewerage (don’t belittle sewerage—society is structured around it).</p>
